Communities Views Module

This module contains view functions for community management functionality
in the UniSpaces social networking application. It handles community creation,
post management, and community interaction features.

Key Features:
- Community creation with hierarchical structure (super/sub communities)
- Automatic membership assignment upon creation
- Form-based community management
- User authentication requirements

Dependencies:
- Django shortcuts for rendering and redirects
- Authentication decorators for security
- Community models and forms

Usage:
These views are mapped to URLs in communities/urls.py and handle
the business logic for community-related user interactions.

    Handle community creation with hierarchical structure support
    
    This view manages the creation of both super communities (parent communities)
    and sub-communities (child communities). The hierarchical system allows for
    organizational structure like Universities -> Departments -> Study Groups.
    
    Supports both regular form submission and AJAX requests for modal popup.
    
    Process Flow:
    1. User fills out community creation form
    2. System validates for duplicate community names
    3. System determines if creating super or sub community
    4. For super communities: Creates parent + initial sub-community
    5. For sub communities: Creates child under existing parent
    6. Automatically assigns creator as member of new community(ies)
    7. Returns success response (JSON for AJAX, redirect for regular form)
    
    Args:
        request: HTTP request object containing form data
        
    Returns:
        JsonResponse: For AJAX requests with success/error data
        HttpResponse: For regular requests - rendered form page or redirect
        
    Security:
        - Requires user authentication via @login_required decorator
        - Validates community name uniqueness within same parent
        - Automatic membership prevents orphaned communities
